This is the source code for my personal profile site, hosted at [gabemcwilliams.info](https://gabemcwilliams.info).  
It‚Äôs built with FastAPI on the backend and a lightweight frontend stack (currently deciding between Streamlit, plain HTML, or a modern JS framework depending on mood, caffeine level, and time).

## Features (Planned or Existing)

- Serves my resume and project links
- Highlights key skills and areas of focus
- Links to GitHub projects, like my Vault/MinIO stack
- Contact form or API endpoint for minimal communication

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **Frontend**: [TBD] (No JS framework cults yet, just vibes)
- **Hosting**: TBD (likely DO + AWS mix)
